Here's an example of how to structure the Markdown file for your assignment:

# Assignment: Algorithms and Pattern Programs

## 1. Name in Star Pattern

Write a program to print your name in a star pattern.

**Example:**
If your name is "KRIPA", the output should look like this and even if its vertical as this will be in terminal, it doesnt matter but make sure to print the name anyhow!!!:

```
*   *  ****   *****  ****    ***  
*  *   *   *    *    *   *  *   * 
***    ****     *    ****   ***** 
*  *   *  *     *    *      *   * 
*   *  *   *  *****  *      *   * 
```

## 2. 3Sum is Zero

Given an array of integers, write a program to find all unique triplets in the array that sum up to zero.

**Example:**
```python
Input: [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
```

## 3. Factorial (Recursive)

Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

**Example:**
```python
Input: 5
Output: 120
```

## 4. Fibonacci Series

Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to the `n`-th term.

**Example:**
```python
Input: 7
Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
```

## 5. Find Pair Whose Sum is Target

Write a program to find a pair of numbers in an array whose sum is equal to a target number.

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [2, 7]
```

## 6. Palindrome (String Slicing and Normal Way)

Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome using both string slicing and the normal way.

**Example:**
```python
Input: "racecar"
Output: True
```
